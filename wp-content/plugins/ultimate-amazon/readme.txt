This plugin scans each new post to create a beautiful catalogue of all Amazon products linked to by your WordPress authors.

== Description ==


Ultimate Amazon turns your written work into a beautifully rendered Amazon shop. It also allows robust cataloguing and export of all Amazon products -- books, music, films, and everything else -- to which your authors have linked. 

We'll deftly scan each newly created post for Amazon links, fetching the properly formed ASIN URL using modern Amazon-preferred methods from the Amazon Advertising API. We'll also fetch the main product image for you and insert that into WordPress's Media database. Then we'll create an XML file and will save it into the database so that you can reference all of the Amazon products your writers are writing about. 

The products can then be displayed using the included carousel, which is a beautifully functional, light-payload, HTML5, touch-compatible, Retina-capable way of building your authors' recommended items into your WordPress site in any location you choose. 

Note: Ultimate Amazon does not automatically add Affiliate tags to your posts' Amazon links. To do that, try Paul Stuttard's Amazon Link. https://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-link/. Amazon Link and Ultimate Amazon have been tested up to the specifications noted to work properly together.
